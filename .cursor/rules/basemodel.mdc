# Chapter 2: BaseModel

In the [previous chapter](tokenizer.mdc), we learned how the `jaxgarden.Tokenizer` prepares text data into JAX arrays suitable for neural network processing. Now, we turn our attention to the core building block for the models themselves: `BaseModel`.

**Motivation:** Building diverse neural network models (like Llama, BERT, etc.) requires a consistent structure. Without a common base, each model implementation might handle configuration, parameter management (state), saving/loading checkpoints, and interacting with external resources (like the Hugging Face Hub) differently. This leads to code duplication, inconsistencies, and makes it harder to develop, maintain, and reuse components. `BaseModel` addresses this by providing an abstract base class that defines a standard interface and implements shared functionalities.

**Central Use Case:** Defining a new neural network model within the `jaxgarden` ecosystem. For example, when implementing a model like [LlamaForCausalLM](llamaforcausallm.mdc), subclassing `BaseModel` ensures it correctly handles its configuration ([BaseConfig](baseconfig.mdc)), manages its learnable parameters and mutable states using Flax NNX conventions, can be saved and loaded consistently using Orbax, and provides a standardized way to import weights from equivalent Hugging Face models.

## Key Concepts

`BaseModel` establishes several core responsibilities and provides associated features:

1.  **Configuration Management:** Each `BaseModel` instance holds a configuration object, typically a subclass of [BaseConfig](baseconfig.mdc), which stores hyperparameters and architectural details (e.g., number of layers, hidden size).
2.  **Flax NNX Foundation:** It inherits from `flax.nnx.Module`, making every `jaxgarden` model an NNX module. This enables the powerful state management capabilities of NNX.
3.  **State Handling:**
    *   `state` property: Provides easy access to the model's `nnx.State` (learnable parameters and mutable states), separated from the static graph definition.
    *   `state_dict` property: Returns the state as a nested dictionary of JAX arrays, suitable for serialization frameworks like Orbax.
4.  **Checkpointing (Save/Load):** Offers `save` and `load` methods that use `orbax-checkpoint` (`ocp`) to serialize and deserialize the model's `state_dict` to/from disk, ensuring consistent checkpointing across all models.
5.  **Hugging Face (HF) Integration Interface:** Defines a standard workflow for interacting with the Hugging Face Hub:
    *   `download_from_hf`: Static method to download model artifacts (like config and weights) from a repository.
    *   `iter_safetensors`: Static method to efficiently iterate over tensors stored in `.safetensors` files.
    *   `convert_weights_from_hf`: An *abstract* method that subclasses *must* implement to translate HF weights into the `jaxgarden` model's state structure.
    *   `from_hf`: Orchestrates the download, iteration, and conversion process to initialize a `jaxgarden` model instance with weights from the Hub.

## Using `BaseModel`

`BaseModel` is an abstract class, so you typically interact with its *subclasses* (like `LlamaForCausalLM`). However, understanding its interface is crucial for both using and implementing models.

### Initialization (Subclass Implementation)

When creating a new model (e.g., `MyCustomModel`), you must subclass `BaseModel` and call its `__init__` method using `super().__init__(...)`.

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
from flax import nnx
from jaxgarden.models.base import BaseModel, BaseConfig
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class MyConfig(BaseConfig):
    hidden_size: int = 128
    # ... other params

class MyCustomModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self, config: MyConfig, *, rngs: nnx.Rngs):
        # Call the parent BaseModel constructor FIRST
        super().__init__(config, rngs=rngs, dtype=jnp.float32) # Specify dtype, etc.

        # Initialize model layers (e.g., using nnx.Linear)
        self.dense = nnx.Linear(config.hidden_size, config.hidden_size, rngs=rngs)
        # ... other layers

    def __call__(self, x: jnp.ndarray) -> jnp.ndarray:
        # Define the forward pass
        return self.dense(x)

# --- Usage ---
config = MyConfig()
rngs = nnx.Rngs(0) # Or more sophisticated key splitting
model = MyCustomModel(config=config, rngs=rngs)
print("Model initialized.")
```

**Explanation:** The subclass `__init__` first calls `BaseModel.__init__`, passing the configuration object (`config`) and NNX random number generators (`rngs`). It also specifies other base parameters like `dtype`. Then, it proceeds to define its own layers (like `self.dense`).

### Accessing State

You can easily access the model's parameters and mutable states.

```python
# Assuming 'model' is an instance of a BaseModel subclass
# Get the nnx.State object
model_state = model.state
print(f"Type of model.state: {type(model_state)}")
# Output: Type of model.state: <class 'flax.experimental.nnx.graph_utils.State'>

# Get the state as a pure dictionary (for saving/inspection)
model_state_dict = model.state_dict
print(f"Type of model.state_dict: {type(model_state_dict)}")
# Output: Type of model.state_dict: <class 'dict'>
print(f"Keys in state_dict: {list(model_state_dict.keys())}")
# Example Output: Keys in state_dict: ['dense']
# (Actual keys depend on the layers defined in MyCustomModel)
```

**Explanation:**
*   `.state` uses `nnx.split(self, nnx.Param, ...)[1]` internally to separate the mutable `nnx.State` from the static graph definition.
*   `.state_dict` takes the `.state` and converts it into a standard Python dictionary using `nnx.to_pure_dict()`, making it easy to serialize.

### Saving and Loading Checkpoints

`BaseModel` provides convenient methods for checkpointing using Orbax.

```python
import os
import tempfile

# Create a temporary directory for saving
save_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
save_path = os.path.join(save_dir, "my_model_checkpoint")

# Save the model's state_dict
print(f"Saving model state to: {save_path}")
model.save(save_path)
# Output: Saving model state to: /tmp/tmpxxxxxxx/my_model_checkpoint
print(f"Files in save dir: {os.listdir(save_path)}")
# Output: Files in save dir: ['jaxgarden_state'] (Orbax checkpoint structure)


# Create a new 'empty' model instance (shapes must match)
rngs_load = nnx.Rngs(1) # Use a different seed for demonstration
new_model = MyCustomModel(config=config, rngs=rngs_load)

# Load the saved state into the new model instance
print(f"Loading model state from: {save_path}")
loaded_model = new_model.load(save_path)
print("Model loaded successfully.")

# Clean up the temporary directory
import shutil
shutil.rmtree(save_dir)
```

**Explanation:**
*   `model.save(path)` saves the dictionary returned by `model.state_dict` to the specified `path` using `ocp.StandardCheckpointer`. The actual checkpoint data is typically stored in a subdirectory named `jaxgarden_state` (defined by `DEFAULT_PARAMS_FILE`).
*   `new_model.load(path)` uses `ocp.StandardCheckpointer` to restore the saved state dictionary. It requires an existing model instance (`new_model`) with the *same structure* (graph definition) to load the state into. It returns a *new* model instance (`loaded_model`) with the graph and the loaded state merged.

### Hugging Face Integration (Usage & Implementation)

`BaseModel` defines the *interface* for loading weights from Hugging Face. The actual conversion logic resides in the subclass's implementation of `convert_weights_from_hf`.

**1. Using `from_hf` (User Perspective):**

A user wanting to load HF weights into a compatible `jaxgarden` model (e.g., `LlamaForCausalLM`) would call `from_hf` on an *initialized* instance.

```python
# Example using LlamaForCausalLM (Conceptual - requires Llama code)
# from jaxgarden.models.llama import LlamaConfig, LlamaForCausalLM

# hf_model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf" # Example HF model ID
# config = LlamaConfig(...) # Configure based on the HF model
# rngs_hf = nnx.Rngs(42)
# llama_model = LlamaForCausalLM(config, rngs=rngs_hf)

# print(f"Initializing Llama model from Hugging Face: {hf_model_id}")
# try:
#    # This call triggers download, iteration, and conversion via convert_weights_from_hf
#    llama_model.from_hf(
#        hf_model_id,
#        # token="hf_...", # Optional Hugging Face token
#        force_download=False, # Set to True to re-download
#        save_in_orbax=True, # Save converted weights locally
#        remove_hf_after_conversion=True # Clean up original HF download
#    )
#    print("Model successfully initialized from Hugging Face.")
# except NotImplementedError:
#    print(f"NOTE: {type(llama_model).__name__} does not implement HF conversion.")
# except Exception as e:
#    print(f"Error during HF conversion: {e}")
print("Skipping actual HF conversion example execution.") # Avoid actual download/conversion
```

**Explanation:** Calling `model.from_hf(hf_model_id, ...)` orchestrates the entire process. It downloads the specified model, iterates through its weights, calls the model's specific `convert_weights_from_hf` method, updates the model's state, and optionally saves the converted weights and cleans up the downloaded HF files.

**2. Implementing `convert_weights_from_hf` (Model Developer Perspective):**

If you are implementing a new `jaxgarden` model that should support HF weight conversion, you *must* override `convert_weights_from_hf`.

```python
from typing import Any
from collections.abc import Iterator

class MyCustomModelWithHF(MyCustomModel): # Inherits from MyCustomModel above
    # ... (potentially different __init__ if layers map to HF names)

    def convert_weights_from_hf(
        self, state: nnx.State, hf_weights: Iterator[tuple[str, jnp.ndarray]]
    ) -> None:
        """Converts HF weights to this model's state format."""
        print("Starting HF weight conversion for MyCustomModelWithHF...")
        for hf_key, hf_tensor in hf_weights:
            print(f"Processing HF key: {hf_key}, shape: {hf_tensor.shape}")
            # --- Conversion Logic ---
            # Map the hf_key to the corresponding key in the jaxgarden model's state
            # This is highly model-specific.
            if hf_key == "transformer.layer.0.dense.weight":
                # Example: Assign HF weight to 'dense.kernel' in our model's state
                # May require transposition (T) or reshaping
                if hasattr(state.dense, "kernel"):
                   state.dense.kernel.value = hf_tensor.T # Example: Transpose needed
                   print(f"  -> Mapped to state['dense']['kernel']")
                else:
                   print(f"  -> Key 'dense.kernel' not found in state.")

            # elif hf_key == "...":
                # Handle other keys...
            else:
                print(f"  -> Key not mapped.")
        print("HF weight conversion finished.")

# --- Conceptual Usage ---
# config_hf = MyConfig(...)
# rngs_hf = nnx.Rngs(0)
# my_hf_model = MyCustomModelWithHF(config_hf, rngs=rngs_hf)
# my_hf_model.from_hf("some-hf-repo/my-custom-model") # Would call the implemented method
```

**Explanation:**
*   The method receives the model's current `state` (an `nnx.State` object, allowing direct modification via `.value = ...`) and an `iterator` (`hf_weights`) yielded by `BaseModel.iter_safetensors`.
*   The core task is to loop through `hf_weights`, and for each `(hf_key, hf_tensor)`, determine the corresponding parameter in the `jaxgarden` model's `state` and assign the `hf_tensor` (potentially after transformations like transpose `.T`).
*   This mapping logic (`if hf_key == ...`) is the most critical and model-specific part. `BaseModel` itself provides the framework but not the specific conversion rules.

## Internal Implementation

Let's look under the hood at how `BaseModel` implements its core functionalities (referencing `jaxgarden/models/base.py`).

1.  **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Stores the `config`, `dtype`, `param_dtype`, `precision`, and `rngs` passed by the subclass. It doesn't initialize any layers itself, relying on the subclass for that.

2.  **State Properties (`state`, `state_dict`)**:
    *   `state`: Directly calls `nnx.split(self, nnx.Param, ...)[1]` to get the `nnx.State` object containing parameters (`nnx.Param`) and other mutable variables.
    *   `state_dict`: Calls `self.state` to get the `nnx.State` and then passes it to `nnx.to_pure_dict(state)` to obtain the serializable dictionary format.

3.  **Saving/Loading (`save`, `load`)**:
    *   `save(path)`: Gets the `state_dict`, creates an `ocp.StandardCheckpointer()`, and calls `checkpointer.save(os.path.join(path, DEFAULT_PARAMS_FILE), state_dict)`. It waits for the save to complete.
    *   `load(path)`: Creates an `ocp.StandardCheckpointer()`, calls `checkpointer.restore(...)` to get the saved dictionary. It then uses `nnx.eval_shape` to get an abstract version of the current model instance, splits it into abstract graphdef and state, uses `nnx.replace_by_pure_dict` to populate the abstract state with the restored dictionary values, and finally merges the original graphdef with the populated state using `nnx.merge` to return the loaded model.

4.  **Hugging Face Integration (`download_from_hf`, `iter_safetensors`, `from_hf`)**:

    *   `download_from_hf(repo_id, ...)`: A static method that simply calls `huggingface_hub.snapshot_download` to fetch all necessary files from the specified HF repository to a local directory.
    *   `iter_safetensors(path)`: A static method that finds all `.safetensors` files in the given directory path. It iterates through each file, opens it using `safetensors.safe_open(..., framework='jax')`, and yields `(key, tensor)` pairs for all tensors within that file. This allows lazy loading of weights.
    *   `from_hf(...)`: This instance method orchestrates the conversion:
        *   Determines local download (`local_dir`) and save (`save_dir`) paths.
        *   Calls `BaseModel.download_from_hf` to get the HF model files.
        *   Calls `BaseModel.iter_safetensors` to get the weight iterator.
        *   Gets the current model's `state`.
        *   Calls `self.convert_weights_from_hf(state, weights)` -> **This is the call to the subclass's implementation.**
        *   Calls `nnx.update(self, state)` to apply the modifications made within `convert_weights_from_hf` back to the model instance.
        *   Optionally removes the downloaded HF directory (`shutil.rmtree`).
        *   Optionally calls `self.save(save_dir)` to save the converted weights in Orbax format.

        end
        BaseModel-->>-User: Returns None (model state is updated)

    ```
*   `convert_weights_from_hf(...)`: This method within `BaseModel` itself simply raises `NotImplementedError`. Subclasses *must* provide their own version.

## Conclusion

`BaseModel` serves as the cornerstone for all neural network models in `jaxgarden`. By inheriting from `flax.nnx.Module` and providing standardized methods for configuration handling, state management (`state`, `state_dict`), checkpointing (`save`, `load` via Orbax), and a clear interface for Hugging Face model conversion (`from_hf`, `convert_weights_from_hf`), it promotes consistency, reduces boilerplate code, and simplifies model development and usage within the JAX ecosystem. Every specific model architecture built in `jaxgarden` leverages this foundation.

Understanding `BaseModel` is essential before diving into specific model implementations. The next chapter will look closer at the configuration aspect managed by its partner class.

**Next:** [BaseConfig](baseconfig.mdc)
